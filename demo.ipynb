      "comment_content The McCafé at Tampines Mall deserves some honorable mention! It has one of the most relaxing and chill environment a McCafé can get. For this outlet, the McDonald&#39;s side and the McCafé is separated, which gives a sense of exclusivity as you enjoy a good cup of coffee. Service wise, it&#39;s thumbs up! Even if you order just a simple cup of flat white, the barista will at least bother to do a little latte art for you (this service is not consistently seen at other McCafé outlets). On the downside, this is not a 24 hour outlet and it can be crowded on weekends and Friday evenings. Other than that, thumbs up for the superb service!\n",

      "comment_content I love to frequent McCafe for their MELTS. Chocolate Melts, Cinnamon Melts.. ohhh so sinful. It&#39;s not only cheap and affordable, the people here are nice. I love their iced tea and their mango smoothie as well. <br><br>If you are looking for a good place to cram at McCafe here will be a good place. On the downside for me, this place is sadly a little far...\n",
